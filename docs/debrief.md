## Bugs found
- `generateLastModifiedDateFilter` had an issue with the filter operator. I changed `GTQ -> GT` and `LTQ -> LT`.
- Debugging revealed that `account.lastPulledDates.meetings` is `undefined` because its constructor is `Document`, which does not include the `meetings` key and was breaking the sort filter. However, `accounts` and `companies` are correctly returned in `Object.keys(account.lastPulledDates)`. To resolve this, I reconstructed the full object using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(account.lastPulledDates))`, ensuring the `meetings` value is properly retrieved.

## Code quality and readability
- A refactor to filter the accounts by hubId and probably keep that in a cache (if possible) to avoid reprocessing everytime `domain.integrations.hubspot.accounts.find(account => account.hubId === hubId)` and the filters on all methods.
- Better naming, for example `q` it's hard to follow and understand what it is.
- Add logs  to follow up and debug potential issues, specially for production deployments

## Project architecture
- Split the business logic and the API calls, like
  - Refresh token should go in `auth` file or service
  - Search for data and API calls should go in a `hubspotService`
  - Split all queue management

## Code performance
- Implementing batch processing to reduce API calls and speeds up processing.
- Setting a backoff mechanism with a max retry limit prevents unnecessary API load.
- Use Promise.all() to run asynchronous API calls concurrently, reducing idle time and improving performance, but be mindful of API rate limits and response sizes to avoid throttling.
